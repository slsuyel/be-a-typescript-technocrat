# TypeScript 

This repository aims to provide a quick reference for TypeScript interview preparation.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is a statically typed superset of JavaScript that adds optional static types to the language. It helps catch errors early in the development process and makes JavaScript code more scalable and maintainable.

## Core Concepts to Cover

1. **TypeScript Basics:**
   - Variables and Data Types
   - Functions
   - Interfaces
   - Classes
   - Generics

2. **Type Annotations and Inference:**
   - Explaining the concept of static typing and how type annotations work in TypeScript.

3. **TypeScript Tooling:**
   - tsconfig.json: Understanding its significance and basic configurations.
   - Compiler Options: Key compiler flags and settings.

4. **Advanced TypeScript:**
   - Union and Intersection Types
   - Type Guards and Type Assertion
   - Decorators
   - Modules and Namespaces

5. **Error Handling and Debugging:**
   - Handling common errors and debugging strategies in TypeScript.

## Sample Interview Questions
